# TO RUN TESTS:
#  1) copy this file to test.cfg
#  2) fill in the mongodb-host url in both [catalog-test] and [NarrativeMethodStore]
#  3) set the nms-admin-user and nms-admin-password or nms-admin-token to a
#      kb user that matches the method-spec-admin-users list in
#      the [NarrativeMethodStore section]
